	        <h2>About Me</h2>
		    <p>Q: Tell us a little bit about yourself.</p><br>
		
		    <p>
		       A: My name is Brian Lam and I'm from Los Angeles currently pursuing a degree in computer science from UCSD.
		       I like playing video games, swimming, playing basketball, and watching TV shows in my spare time. I also love traveling;
		       the banner above is a photo I took of the financial center in New York City during my trip there over the summer.
		    </p><br>
		
		    <p>
		      Q: What influenced your decision to obtain a degree in Computer Science?
		    </p><br>
		
		    <p>
		      A: One of my biggest hobbies is playing video games and I have always wanted to put myself in the developers' shoes to learn how video games
		      are created and the inspirations that drive the creation of such innovative technology. However, halfway through college and after extensive research 
		      about video game development, I realized that I did not want to create video games for a living because I found it to be too stressful and demanding 
		      for my own interests. I would rather work at lower profile company and do video game development on the side as a hobby rather than a full-time position. 
		      Therefore, my decision to pursue a degree in Computer Science largely stems from my interest in contributing to a team in maintaining/developing a large 
		      scale application that everyone can use on a daily basis. Hopefully with this experience, I will go on to create an application myself that I can share 
		      with the rest of the world.
		    </p><br>
		
		    <p>
		      Q: What are some of your biggest aspirations in life?
		    </p><br>
		
		    <p>
		      A: The biggest long term goal that has always stuck with me is the ability to give back to my parents. They have sacrificed so much for me to be where I am today,
		      and I wouldn't be standing here without the unconditional love from my parents and family. As immigrants from Vietnam and Cambodia, my parents started out life
		      in the United States with little to nothing in their pockets, yet managed to build the foundation for a comfortable standard of living through hard work and perseverance.
		      I want to land my dream job and be able to support my parents just as they have supported me throughout my childhood. In terms of the work environment, I want to be a part of a team that
		      allows me to think creatively and work towards developing new and innovative software that a wide range of audiences can use on a daily basis.
