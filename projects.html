                A side-scrolling 2D video game where the player moves left and right across the bottom of the screen.
		  		The object is to catch the falling dogs and cats while simultaneously avoiding the feces. Each cat and dog is worth 1 point, and a counter at the top keeps track of
		  		the player's total points. The game ends when the player catches poop. This was my first attempt at creating a video game, and the process seemed daunting at first.
		  		However, my friend and I decided to do some research on how to create a simple video game. We decided to use LibGDX which is an application programming interface
		  		or a template that allows us to easily make our own additions and changes to tailor the game to our needs. After coding in the main functionality, we were
		  		proud to have created our first working video game. However, the game itself is still a work in progress as there are a multitude of aspects that we can improve
		  		on. Notable examples include aesthetics, the addition of an in-game shop where the player can purchase skins for the character, as well as more objectives.
		  		The game itself will be available on the Google Play Store in addition to being a desktop game.

		  	  <p>
		  	    An Android banking application that allows users to create their own bank accounts, deposit money, withdraw money,
		  	    and transfer funds to other users who are also using the same app. Users can view their balances on each account as well
		  	    see which transactions were recorded on each account. Tacode was a 10-week long project out of CSE110 at UCSD,
		  	    in which I worked with a team to develop the front-end aspect of the application. I worked as a business analyst and
		  	    focused on what the customer needed. This included coming up with user stories which are scenarios in which the customer
		  	    would use our application and what they would see on their end. With this in mind, we decided to make the user interface
		  	    as clean and intuitive as possible.
