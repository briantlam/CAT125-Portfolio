		  	<h2>Experience</h2>
		  	<p>
		  		I have worked with multiple programming languages and have extensive experience with object-oriented programming, most notably Java, C, and C++.
		  		The word cloud to the left showcases the languages I'm most fluent in, as well as a link to my resume for a more in-depth description of my qualifications.

		  		Coming into college, I had no prior experience in programming and was eager to tackle my first actual programming language. I soon learned about the hardships that come
		  		with figuring out efficient algorithms, implementing data structures, as well as debugging code. Struggling to create simple programs such as a calculator, I felt
		  		like giving up computer science entirely. I had a passion for creating new things from scratch, apparently I just wasn't good at it. I sought advice from friends
		  		and family on what to do next and they all gave me the same answer: stick with it. I figured that I was giving up too early, and that the stress from classes, assignments, 
		  		and exams was pressuring me into making me quit. I continued to program and improved upon my skills of implementing efficient, clean, and well-written code.
		  		Future classes placed me into teams where we collaborated on quarter-long projects that would eventually redefine my view on coding as a whole. I learned that you
		  		don't have to be a genius to be the best programmer in the world. All it takes is hard work and determination to power through what may seem difficult at first, but entirely
		  		doable in the end. I made life-long friends after working together to create innovative applications that could be both useful and entertaining.
		  	</p><br>
		  	<p>
		  		Using the experience that I gained throughout my college career combined with my hobby of playing video games, I decided to collaborate with a friend to create
		  		a video game as a side project. The game is called Rain, a side-scrolling 2d video game where the player moves left and right across the bottom of the screen.
		  		When we were in the first phase of designing the game, we had no idea where to start. After extensive research, we decided to use the LibGDX application programming
		  		interface which is essentially a template for creating 2d video games. This turned out to be a good starting point for us, as the API was easy to follow and
		  		allowed us to modify the interface with what we wanted the game to have in the final design. We drew influences from popular yet simple games like Flappy Bird
		  		and Crossy Road. We were mesmerized at how the objective of these games were so simple, yet immensely difficult to achieve a high score in. We decided to keep
		  		this concept as the driving factor when implementing the main objective of our own game.
		  		I plan to use this video game as a gateway to future employers for them to see my drive for creative and innovative design.
